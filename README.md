## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You must have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dheepaky/Mern-Cloudinary.git](https://github.com/dheepaky/Mern-Cloudinary.git)
    cd Mern-Cloudinary
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies in both client and server directories:**
    ```bash
    # Install server dependencies
    cd server
    npm install

    # Install client dependencies
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named **`.env`** in the **`server`** directory and add your credentials.

    ```ini
    # MongoDB Connection
    MONGO_URI="YOUR_MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING"

    # Cloudinary Credentials (Get these from your Cloudinary Dashboard)
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="YOUR_CLOUD_NAME"
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="YOUR_API_SECRET"
    
    # Optional: Server port
    PORT=5000 
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Navigate back to the **`server`** directory and run the development script:
    ```bash
    npm run dev  # Requires nodemon
    # OR
    npm start 
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    Navigate to the **`client`** directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React application will open in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

You're all set! Now you can test the upload functionality and see your assets appear instantly on Cloudinary.
